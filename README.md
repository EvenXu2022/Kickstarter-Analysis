## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The month of May shows the highest number of launching project with highest successful funding ratio in Theater category. However, December presents the lowest number of launching projects with lowest successful ratio.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Goal range in 1000 to 4999 shows the most launching projects and successful funding projects. However, the goal range in less than 1000 has the highest successful ration among others since the funding is small.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

This data set has the timeframe limitation which only presents history years from 2009 to Mar 2017. Therefor, this data won't provide nearest historical analysis to audience. It will bring down the analytical value. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

One possible graph could be using a stacked bar graph to show all Parent Categories on Y-axis and Country on X-axis with Year as a filter which compares each country's total funding in a year or years total. it also compares the parent category funding within a country and across countries.

The other possible analysis is to use a table to compare the total Backers count or average donation in each category(on columns) and Goal ranges on rows in the successful outcome (as a filter). this table will tells which category are most popular funding area people are willing to donate and how much they are willing to donate.
